Agile has becomes a famous interactive process for developing software.

# Why Agile

## Why not Waterfall

In a waterfall, every stage depends on the previous stage.

- Con: no variation, adaptability, or other error once a waterfall project is set in motion.
- Pro: clear, productive, good time management, and available progress tracing.

Agile is more **flexibility, adaptivity, and error tolerable**.

# Types

Some agile types include Scrum, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). This course talks about scrum.

There are several roles, backlogs, and Ceremonies in the scrum.

## Points

<10 points per task. Fab number is better.

Velocity comparisons by number of points completed per sprint is a senseless way to compare teams because the meaning of 1 point / 3 points / 5 points / etc. is determined by each team internally. One team's typical 3 pointer could be much harder than another team's 5 pointer.

## Roles

- Product Owner: maximize the return the business gets on investments. Including salary, company renting fee, facilities, software, and maintenance.
    - They own the product backlog.
    - orders (prioritizes) the items in the product backlog.
- Scrum Master: a coach who guides the team to an over-high level of cohesiveness, self-organization, and performance.
    - They set the points.
    - scrum expert and advisor
    - impediment bulldozer
    - facilitator
- Team Member: how work done. What tech and tool to use. Who does which task.

## Artifacts

- Product: list of deliverables for a product.
- Sprint: the TODO lists of a sprint.
- Turndown Chart: A burn chart shows how work remains on a given day. It is a good idea to start daily standup with it so that the development team can get timely real-time feedback about whether they are on track or not.
- Task Board: Tasks of to do, doing and done.

## Ceremonies

- Sprint Planning Meeting: 2h/week
    - marks the beginning of the sprint.
    - commit to a set of deliverables for the sprint.
    - identifies the tasks that must be completed in order to deliver the agreed upon user stories
- Daily Scrum: < 10 mins, every week day
    - hold this meeting at the start of their work day
    - inspect and adapt the work the team members are doing
- Story Time: 1h/week
    - product owner will do: Define and Refine Acceptance Criteria
    - discussing and improving the stories in your product backlog, which contains all the stories for future sprints.
- Sprint Review: 30-60-120/sprint
    - invite any and all stakeholders.
    - demonstrating the stories that did get done.
    - stakeholders will have feedback and ideas, and the product owner and the team members will gather this feedback.
- Retrospective: 1-2 h/sprint
    - Only the team.
    - focus on what was learned during the sprint, and how that learning can be applied to make some improvement.
