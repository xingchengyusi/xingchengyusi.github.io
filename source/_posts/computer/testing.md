## Type

- System Testing: carried out on the whole system in the context of either system requirement specifications, functional requirement specifications, or in a contest of both.
- E2E Testing: test whether the flow of software from the initial stage to the final stage is behaving as expected.
- Unit Testing: a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation.
- Integration Testing: a type of software testing in which the different units, modules, or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity.

## Code Coverage

It is a software testing metric that determines the number of lines of code that are successfully validated under a test procedure, which in turn, helps in analyzing how comprehensively a software is verified.

The only factor that affects the code coverage, is whether it is tested, not success or fail.
